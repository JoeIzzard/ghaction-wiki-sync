# action-wiki-sync

This action is designed to sync a folder in your repo with the Wiki Repo, allowing for better contributor worklow and ease of editing the Wiki.

## Example

```yaml
on:
    push:
        branches:
            - master
    pull_request:
        branches:
            - master
name: Wiki Sync
jobs:
    update-wiki:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@master
          - name: Sync Wiki
            uses: joeizzard/action-wiki-sync@master
            with:
                username: example
                access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                wiki_folder: wiki
                commit_username: 'Example Name'
                commit_email: 'example@users.noreply.github.com'
                commit_message: 'action: wiki sync'
```
In this example, the `wiki` folder will be synced with the wiki repo everytime a commit to the master branch occurs or when a pull request to the master branch is merged. This is a fully working example, just change the variables under the `with` section to get started.
